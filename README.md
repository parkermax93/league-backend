# README

This is the League Generator website! This allows a user to view the champions throughout the game League of Legends, and organize them by the lane they are typically assigned to. This project will eventually have added functionality to see a randomizer to give a champion of a certain lane to help those who are indecisive pick a character to play! "What if a new champion comes out, how will that get added to the rotation!?". Have no fear! I have added a form to add a new character to insure that whenever a new champion is added, I can add it just as fast. 

Installation: 
To install this application, you will need to download the front-end and back-end repos at https://github.com/parkermax93/league-frontend, and https://github.com/parkermax93/league-backend. Once these are downloaded, you will need to run 'bundle install' to make sure all required gems are installed and able to be ran. The backend server will need to go live by typing 'rails s' in the console, and then opening the index.html file on the front-end repo with your internet browser of choice (although this was only tested in Google Chrome).
